# Tic Tac TAI 🤖

>Tic Tac TAI — A Tic Tac Toe game powered by a Large Language Model + React 🧠

A modern Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can test your skills against a smart AI opponent. This project was created as part of a "30 Days, 30 Apps" challenge. The "TAI" in the name stands for "Tic-Tac-Toe AI", highlighting the AI-powered opponent whose moves are generated by an OpenAI GPT model via the OpenRouter API.

## ✨ Features

*   **Classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe Gameplay**: Enjoy the timeless game with a modern twist.
*   **Intelligent AI Opponent**: Play against an AI that uses a large language model to determine its next move.
*   **Score Tracking**: Scores for "You (X)" and "AI (O)" are tracked across multiple games.
*   **Sleek UI**: A clean, dark-mode interface built with Tailwind CSS for a great user experience.
*   **Smooth Animations**: Enjoy subtle tap animations on the game board, powered by Framer Motion.
*   **Play Again**: Easily restart the game after a win, loss, or draw to keep the fun going.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Framework**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **Animation**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
*   **AI Opponent**:
    *   **Primary**: DeepSeek via [OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai/)
    *   **Fallback**: Claude via [OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai/)
    *   **Fail-safe**: Local JavaScript logic for guaranteed valid moves

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended) and npm/yarn.
*   An API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) to enable the AI opponent.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kishore0765/Tic-Tac-TAI-using-DeepSeek-AI-React.git
    cd tic-tac-tai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your OpenRouter API key. The application is set up to use Vite's environment variables.

    ```
    VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL provided in your terminal).

## ⚙️ How It Works

The game's logic is managed within the main `App.jsx` component using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

1.  **Game State**: The board is represented by a 9-element array. The player's turn, winner status, and score are all stored in the React state.
2.  **Player's Move**: When the player clicks a square, the `handleClick` function updates the board with an "X" and sets the turn to the AI.
3.  **AI's Turn**: A `useEffect` hook detects when it's the AI's turn. It calls the `getAIMoverFromOpenRouter` utility, which sends the current board state to the OpenRouter API. The AI model analyzes the board and returns the index for its best move.
4.  **Game Loop**: The board is updated with the AI's move ("O"), and the turn is passed back to the player.
5.  **Winner Check**: After every move, the `checkWinner` utility is called to determine if a player has won or if the game is a draw. The UI updates accordingly to show the result and a "Play Again" button.
